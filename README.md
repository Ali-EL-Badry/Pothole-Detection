# Pothole Detection 🚗💥

A deep learning-based solution for detecting potholes in road surfaces using computer vision. The system utilizes **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** 🧠 object detection models for fast and accurate pothole detection in images and videos. This project aims to improve road safety 🚧, assist in infrastructure maintenance 🛠️, and enhance autonomous vehicle navigation 🚙.

## Features ✨

- **Real-time pothole detection** from video streams or images 🎥📸.
- **Pretrained YOLO models** (YOLOv5, YOLOv8) for fast and accurate pothole detection ⚡.
- **Custom dataset** built from real-world road images, ensuring diverse road conditions 🛣️.
- **Data augmentation** techniques like rotation 🔄, flipping ↔️, and scaling 🔍 to improve model robustness.

## Technologies 💻

- **Languages**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
- **Object Detection**: YOLO (v5, v8) 🔍

## Installation ⚙️
